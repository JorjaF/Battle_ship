Iteration 3 did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach designing this iteration?
we reviewed the requirements for the iteration and determined that we needed a new game class, and a runner file. then we used true TTD to make sure that our code was working as intended 
If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on? 
if we had one more day we believe that we would have completed iteration 3. (We would also do some more refactoring but since we did a bunch last night that would not be our priority)
Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project.
Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project. 
On this project we did almost exclusive live group work so that we would all have input on the code and test in real time
